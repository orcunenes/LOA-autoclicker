"# LOA-autoclicker" 

This Autoclicker was made for personal use.
I've been wasting my time while trying to find an item on Luck chest, so I made an auto-clicker that claims quests for me.

You can use this on an emulator and do find the item you want while you are away.

To use it, double-click the.bat file and press K.

Setup and rar will be added.
